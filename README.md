# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è WebWalker: A Security-Focused Web Browser in Python üõ°Ô∏è

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**WebWalker** is a Python-based command-line web browser designed with a strong emphasis on security analysis.  It's not your everyday browser; it's built to peek under the hood of websites, revealing hidden elements, suspicious scripts, and detailed certificate information. Think of it as a web detective, uncovering the secrets that websites might be trying to hide.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üåê Basic Web Browsing:** Fetches and displays HTML content from websites.
*   **üîí HTTPS Support:** Securely connects to websites using SSL/TLS.
*   **üìú Certificate Inspection:**  Displays detailed certificate information (issuer, subject, validity, SANs, and more!).  Know who you're connecting to!
*   **üç™ Cookie Handling:**  Parses and stores cookies, allowing for more realistic browsing sessions.
*   **‚û°Ô∏è Redirection Handling:**  Follows HTTP redirects (3xx status codes).
*   **üïµÔ∏è Hidden Element Detection:** Uncovers elements hidden using various techniques:
    *   CSS (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, `opacity: 0`)
    *   Off-screen positioning (large negative `top`/`left` values)
    *   HTML `hidden` attribute
    *   `input type="hidden"`
*   **üö© Suspicious Pattern Detection:** Identifies potentially malicious code patterns:
    *   Inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, `onmouseover`, etc.)
    *   `javascript:` URIs in `href` attributes
    *   `data:` URIs in `iframe` `src` attributes
*   **<binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes> External Script Fetching:** Retrieves and displays the content of external JavaScript files.
*    **_detect_and_report_database** method that could potentially be used to detect db information.
*   **üîç Verbose Output:** Provides detailed information about every step of the process, including HTTP status codes, redirects, and detected anomalies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+
*   Required Libraries (install using pip):
    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webwalker.git  # Replace with your repo URL
    cd webwalker
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python webwalker.py
    ```

3.  **Enter a URL at the prompt:**

    ```
    [+] Enter website address:
    > https://www.example.com
    ```

4.  **Command-Line Options:**

    *   `--url <url>`: Specify the URL directly on the command line.
    *   `--show-cert`: Display detailed certificate information.
    *   `--detect-hidden`: Enable hidden element and suspicious pattern detection.
    *   `--detect-db`: (Experimental) Attempt to detect database-related information

    Example:
        ```bash
        python webwalker.py --url https://www.example.com --show-cert --detect-hidden
        ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview

### `MyHTMLParser` Class

This class extends Python's built-in `HTMLParser` to extract information from HTML documents.

*   `handle_starttag()`:  Processes opening tags.  Identifies links (`<a>`), scripts (`<script>`), and hidden/suspicious elements.
*   `handle_startendtag()`: Handles self-closing tags, like `<img />` or `<br />`.
*   `handle_entityref()` and `handle_charref()`:  Handle HTML entities (like `&lt;`) and character references (like `&#x20;`).
*   `close()`: called when closing tags
*   `links`, `scripts`, `hidden_elements`, `suspicious_patterns`: Lists to store the extracted information.

### `WebBrowserC` Class

This class handles the core web browsing functionality.

*   `__init__()`: Initializes the browser with an empty cookie jar.
*   `webbrowser(url, show_cert, detect_db, detect_hidden)`: The main method.  Fetches the webpage, handles redirects, parses the HTML, and calls the detection methods.
*   `_parse_and_store_cookie(cookie_data)`: Parses a `Set-Cookie` header and stores the cookie.
*   `_print_certificate_info(cert_der)`:  Decodes and displays detailed information from an SSL certificate.
*   `_resolve_url(base_hostname, base_path, relative_url, is_https)`:  Constructs absolute URLs from relative URLs.
*   `_fetch_external_resource(url, detect_db)`:  Fetches the content of an external resource (like a JavaScript file).
*   `_detect_and_report_database`: method that could potentially report db information
